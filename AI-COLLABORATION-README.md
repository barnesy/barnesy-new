# AI Collaboration Framework Page

## Overview

This page documents the collaborative workflow between human creativity and AI capabilities. It showcases the tools, techniques, and thinking patterns that enable breakthrough results in design and development.

## The Formula

**Claude Code Agent + Figma MCP + Schema = Breakthrough Results**

This isn't just a list of tools—it's a framework for working with AI that amplifies human capabilities.

## What's Covered

### 1. The Tools
- **Claude Code Agent**: AI pair programmer with full codebase access
- **Figma MCP**: Design-to-code bridge via Model Context Protocol
- **Schema**: Structured knowledge base for consistent output

### 2. Prompting Styles
Different approaches for different tasks:
- Declarative: State what, not how
- Iterative: Build incrementally
- Contextual: Reference existing patterns
- Constraint-Based: Define boundaries
- Exploratory: Ask "what if"
- Meta-Cognitive: Reflect on process

### 3. Types of Thinking
- System 1: Fast, intuitive
- System 2: Deep, analytical
- Chain of Thought: Step-by-step reasoning
- Meta-Reasoning: Thinking about thinking

### 4. Context Distillation
Four layers of context:
1. Project Context (tech stack, architecture)
2. Design System Context (patterns, tokens)
3. Task Context (current objective)
4. Historical Context (lessons learned)

## Key Features

### Visual Formula
The page opens with a visual representation of the formula, using color-coded components:
- Blue: Claude Code Agent
- Purple: Figma MCP
- Orange: Schema
- Green: Breakthrough Results

### Interactive Tool Cards
Each tool has a detailed card explaining:
- What it does
- Why it matters
- How it's used
- Key capabilities

### Real Examples
Concrete prompt examples showing:
- The prompt
- The approach used
- The result achieved

### Code Snippets
Example schema definitions showing how knowledge is structured for AI consumption.

## Purpose

This page serves multiple purposes:

1. **Educational**: Teaches visitors how to work effectively with AI
2. **Demonstrative**: Proves deep understanding of AI workflows
3. **Differentiating**: Shows unique expertise most designers lack
4. **Transparent**: Opens up the process rather than hiding it

## Why This Matters

Most portfolios show the **what** (finished work). This page shows the **how** (the process). It positions the designer as:
- Forward-thinking (using cutting-edge tools)
- Technical (understanding AI mechanics)
- Systematic (having a framework, not just tactics)
- Transparent (sharing knowledge openly)

## Integration with Portfolio

### Links From:
- Main portfolio work grid (AI Workflow card)
- Design system case study CTA
- Future blog posts about AI

### Links To:
- Design system case study (proof in action)
- Contact section
- Main portfolio

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
1. **Video Demonstrations**: Screen recordings of actual workflows
2. **Live Examples**: Interactive prompt playground
3. **Case Studies**: Before/after comparisons
4. **Metrics**: Quantified improvements (time saved, quality metrics)
5. **Blog Integration**: Deep dives into specific techniques
6. **Community**: Share prompts, schemas, and patterns

## Technical Details

- **File**: `ai-collaboration.html`
- **Style**: Matches barnesy-new design system
- **Theme Support**: Light/dark mode toggle
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly layouts
- **Performance**: Lightweight, no external dependencies

## Content Strategy

This page is designed to:
- **Educate** potential employers/clients about AI workflows
- **Build trust** through transparency
- **Demonstrate expertise** beyond typical design portfolios
- **Generate conversation** about collaboration opportunities

## Maintenance

Keep this page updated with:
- New tools as they're adopted
- Refined techniques as workflows improve
- Real metrics from actual projects
- Case studies as they're completed

## Meta

This page itself demonstrates the collaboration framework:
- Built using Claude Code Agent
- Structured with design system patterns
- Iterated based on feedback
- Documented for future reference

It's not just documentation—it's proof of concept.
